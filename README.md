The program what was done first was that I asked the user to enter number of students. Secondly, I prompt for other students added string on student’s name, int number of test score and number of students. With the use of the array, I started to store average and grades from the students. It was followed with functions where I entered the test grade of the students where I prompt the user to check on my letter grade of the students. Then made changes where was needed. In loops I started to make multiple students with the test scores by adding few things to it. When it came with calculating the average and grade the average I divide it with the amount of number score and average I just  average with the students grade. With the information given on the student’s result was added but changes were made where necessary.
